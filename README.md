# Programmable Transformers

This repository is not very well-organized, because it has mostly been private up till now. Probably the best entry-point is to read the distill.pub-style article I have written.

A copy of the article is currently hosted at https://igor0.github.io/hand/distill/

## To read distill-style article
- Install npm.
- `cd distill`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- Then a browser will open showing the page.
