    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Deep learning is very effective at creating networks that can
      perform complex tasks, but we do not generally have much
      idea <b>how</b> those tasks are performed by these networks.  We
      here propose some new notation that makes it far more possible
      to <b>hardcode</b> neural networks that can perform the same
      sorts of tasks as their learned counterparts. This has several
      benefits:
      <ul>
        <li>The resulting hardcoded networks are <b>extremely
            interpretable</b> and may be useful for some tasks where
          that is a requirement.
        </li>
        <li>The process of hardcoding a network provides valuable
          insight into <b>what kinds of computation are
            performable</b> with the various components of a particular
          architecture.
        </li>
        <li>Hardcoding a network gives a better understanding of the
          <b>space of possible variants</b> of a particular
          architecture.
        </li>
        <li>Hardcoding neural networks for natural language processing
          allows us to encode linguistic knowledge in a format that is
          usable for linguistic competence, thus allowing us
          to <b>rigorously test linguistic theories</b> and
          potentially providing <b>a new experimental framework for
            work in linguistics</b>.
        </li>
        <li>There are several ways to <b>combine hardcoded components
            with learned components</b> to achieve some of the
          advantages of both.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Our goal in this article is to successfully hardcode the weights
      of a Transformer<d-cite key="transformer"></d-cite> in order to
      do classification (is this sentence grammatical or not?) and
      translation (English to French). We present these networks
      piece-by-piece with editable code blocks so that the reader can
      follow along.  While we intend to make this article
      self-contained, readers may find it helpful to consult the
      Illustrated
      Transformer<d-cite key="illustrated-transformer"></d-cite> and
      the Annotated
      Transformer<d-cite key="annotated-transformer"></d-cite> to
      refresh their memories of how Transformer works.
    </p>



    <a class="marker" href="#section-2" id="section-2"><span>2</span></a>
    <h2>Notation</h2>
    <p>Our first bit of notation is for sparse vectors whose nonzero
      entries are small numbers. We first pick an ordered set of
      natural language words (e.g., English words), one per dimension
      of our vector space. We will call these
      words <b>semes</b>.<d-footnote>The term comes from semiotics,
        where it denotes the smallest piece of semantic
        meaning.</d-footnote> Each seme represents a different basis
      vector. We then represent vectors as sums of these basis
      vectors. If our semes are "pig", "peregrine", and "wombat", we
      would represent the vector $$\langle 1, 0, -1\rangle$$ as
      $$\langle \langle +pig - wombat \rangle \rangle$$, while the
      vector $$\langle -2.1, 3.3, 0\rangle$$ would be represented as
      $$\langle\langle -2.1 pig + 3.3 peregrine \rangle \rangle$$.
    </p>
    <p>When writing code, we omit the $$\langle\langle\, \rangle\rangle$$:
      <d-code block="" language="markdown">
        vec1: +pig -wombat
        vec2: -2.1pig +3.3peregrine
      </d-code>
    </p>
    <p>The next bit of notation is for sparse matrices whose nonzero
      entries are small numbers. We represent the $$i,j$$ entry of a
      matrix being $$x\ne 0$$ by $$\{\{ x \, seme_i \rightarrow
      seme_j\}\}$$. If our three semes are again "pig",
      "peregrine", and "wombat", then we have
      <d-math block>
        \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 3\\ 0 & 0 & 4 \end{bmatrix}
        = \{\{ pig\rightarrow pig,
        2 peregrine\rightarrow peregrine,
        3 peregrine \rightarrow wombat,
        4 wombat\rightarrow wombat\}\}
      </d-math>
      <d-math block>
        \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 3 \\ -1 & 2 & -4\\ 0 & 0 & 0
        \end{bmatrix} = \{\{ 3pig\rightarrow wombat,
        -peregrine\rightarrow pig, 2peregrine
        \rightarrow peregrine, -4peregrine \rightarrow
        wombat\}\}
      </d-math>
      and so on.
    </p>
    <p>When writing code, we omit the $$\{\{ \}\}$$ and use $$>$$ in
      place of $$\rightarrow$$:
      <d-code block="" language="markdown">
        mat1: pig>pig, 2peregrine>peregrine, 3peregrine>wombat,
        4wombat>wombat
        mat2: 3pig>wombat, -peregrine>pig, 2peregrine>peregrine,
        -4peregrine>wombat
      </d-code>
    </p>

    <a class="marker" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1"><span>3.1</span></a>
    <h2>Interpretability</h2>

    <p>It is generally accepted that deep neural networks are
      uninterpretable. We show in this article that they can be made
      quite interpretable by using better notation, with no or very
      little change to the architecture. Unfortunately, building a
      network that is able to perform a nontrivial task is quite
      complex and requires either a lot of preliminaries or intimate
      familiarity with the architectures in question; we will
      gradually build up to such networks. To whet the reader&apos;s
      appetite, we show here a simple (vanilla) RNN designed to do
      sentiment analysis, based on the VADER
      algorithm.<d-cite key="vader"></d-cite> (VADER itself is already
      extremely interpretable; this is only meant to demonstrate that
      a fairly simple vanilla RNN can be made just as interpretable.)
    </p>

    <p>
      The following figure can be edited interactively. We have
      provided a bare minimum set of word embeddings (below called
      "lexicon"), so adding additional examples will probably require
      adding additional items to the lexicon.
    </p>

    <aside>Any shortcomings of the network below should not be taken
      to reflect on the VADER algorithm, of which this network is only
      a crude sketch.

    <h2>As a Tool to Build Intuition</h2>

    <p>The process of hardcoding a network provides valuable insight
       into what kinds of computation are performable at all with the
       various components of a particular architecture, as well as
       what kinds of computation are natural (and thus likely easy to
       learn) and which kinds are unnatural (and thus at least
       potentially more difficult to learn). For an example, consider
       the first layer of a Transformer decoder. This layer takes in
       an embedding of the previously emitted word and performs
       various manipulations on it. However, there is a residual
       connection, so that the manipulations simply add things to the
       embedding of the previous word. This makes it somewhat
       difficult to erase the previous word&apos;s embedding, which is
       necessary to avoid simply repeating the previous word ad
       infinitum. This is relatively easy to address with a
       self-attention layer, but it suggests that a Transformer
       network would likely be well-served by adding a pointwise dense
       layer (without a residual connection) between the embedding of
       the previous word and the first decoder layer. It also suggests
       an explanation for the repetitiveness of Transformer networks
       in early training: the network has not yet learned to erase the
       embedding of the previous word sufficiently well. Hopefully
       further explanation will yield many more such insights and
       interventions.
    </p>

    <a class="marker" href="#section-3.3" id="section-3.3"><span>3.3</span></a>
    <h2>Usefulness for Linguistics</h2>

    <p>Hardcoding neural networks for natural language processing
       allows us to encode linguistic knowledge in a format that is
       usable for linguistic competence (e.g., grammaticality
       judgments, entailment judgments, translation, dialogue), thus
       allowing us to rigorously test the sufficiency of a linguistic
       theory for explaining a particular phenomenon. Such work is not
       in any sense new in linguistics (see
       e.g. <d-cite key="openccg"></d-cite>), but we hope that
       high-performing architectures from machine learning such as the
       Transformer add a valuable tool now that we can write
       interpretable transformers.
    </p>

    <a class="marker" href="#section-3.4" id="section-3.4"><span>3.4</span></a>
    <h2>Combining Learning with Programming</h2>
    <p>There are several ways to combine hardcoded components with
       learned components to achieve some of the advantages of
      both. We list several ideas in this vein:
      <ul>
        <li>Initializing a Transformer network from a hand-built set
          of weights, then learning from data on top of this. We can
          definitely create initializations that are far stronger than
          any random initialization. Note that hand-built networks
          tend to have symmetries resulting from their sparse weights,
          so the weights should have noise added to them to break this
          symmetry.
        </li>
        <li>Writing weight matrices as sums of word embedding outer
          products, and then learning only the word embeddings. For
          instance, we can interpret $$\{\{red\rightarrow blue\}\}$$
          as the outer product of the word embedding for "red" and the
          word embedding for "blue". This would allow us to use
          traditional learned word embeddings while still retaining a
          large amount of insight into the internal workings of the
          network. It might also allow us to encode certain semantic
          relationships solely by enumerating examples of the semantic
          relationship. For example, $$\{\{eat\rightarrow animal,
          drink\rightarrow animal, sleep\rightarrow animal,
          see\rightarrow animal\}\}$$ might encode that a subject that
          eats, drinks, sleeps, or sees is probably an animal. Given
          appropriate word embeddings, this might then generalize to
          such activities as hearing, snoozing, sipping, or chewing.
        </li>
        <li>Initializing a Transformer network from hand-built
          weights, then doing some number of steps of gradient descent
          to get <b>proposed new rules</b> to add to the existing
          weight specification rules.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>



    <a class="marker" href="#section-4" id="section-4"><span>4</span></a>
    <h2>Ingredients of Transformer Networks</h2>

    <p>In this section, we lay out the workings of a Transformer
      piece-by-piece, indicating how each can be programmed. In the
      next section, we will actually build a network that classifies
      sentences as grammatical or not.
    </p>



    <a class="marker" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1"><span>4.1</span></a>
    <h2>Pointwise Dense Layers</h2>
    <p>As the next step, we will consider a pointwise dense layer,
      which requires one matrix parameter (the weights) and one vector
      parameter (the biases). Pointwise dense layers are used to
      compute the inputs to dot-product attention, as well as in the
      feed-forward layers of the Transformer.
    </p>
    <p>As a basic example, consider semes
      $$apple,banana,cherry,durian$$. Consider the dense layer with
      weights $$\{\{apple\rightarrow apple, -apple\rightarrow banana,
      -apple \rightarrow cherry, -banana \rightarrow apple,$$ $$banana
      \rightarrow banana, -banana \rightarrow cherry, -cherry
      \rightarrow apple, -cherry \rightarrow banana,$$ $$cherry
      \rightarrow cherry\}\}$$ and bias $$\langle\langle
      -durian\rangle\rangle$$. The following figure allows you to change
      both the parameters of the dense layer and the vectors that get
      run through it.

    <p>
      There are several things to note in these word embeddings.
      Firstly, a "content" word like "meet" or "pig" will generally
      have either itself or some other form of itself as one of its
      components<d-footnote>This happens primarily because we do not
        know of any completely interpretable encoding of semantic
        meanings, and we need some notion of semantics in order to
        perform some tasks, e.g. translation. Pretrained word embeddings
        are at least somewhat interpretable. We will revisit this point
        later when we talk about hybrid hand/learned
        approaches. </d-footnote>, while pronouns are fully specifiable
      in terms of various axes having to do with classic grammatical
      notions like case, gender, person, number, and so on. Secondly,
      content words come with a few extra <b>syntactic</b> components
      describing how the particular form of the word expresses
      grammatical notions like person (for verbs) and number (for both
      verbs and nouns). For instance, "pig" is singular
      $$\langle\langle +sg\rangle\rangle$$, while "pigs" is plural
      $$\langle\langle +pl \rangle\rangle$$.

    <h2>Transformer Feed-Forward Layers</h2>
    <p>Next we consider the feed-forward layers of Transformer. These
      are typically two dense layers with a ReLU nonlinearity between
      them. The intermediate dimension (referred to as the "filter
      size") is usually larger (typically by a factor of four) than the
      hidden size of the network.
    </p>

    <p>One of the primary uses we have found for the Transformer
    feed-forward layer is to allow us to reason about logical
    conjunctions ($$a$$ AND $$b$$) and logical disjunctions ($$a$$ OR
    $$b$$). A single dense layer does not have the representational
    capacity to represent either of these notions in a satisfactory
    manner. In a Transformer feed-forward layer, we can represent
    $$a$$ AND $$b$$ as $$f_{a\, \mathrm{AND}\, b}(v) =
    \mathrm{ReLU}(v\cdot \{\{a\rightarrow x, b\rightarrow x\}\} -
    \langle\langle x \rangle\rangle)$$. Here we can read the value of
    $$a$$ AND $$b$$ out from the coefficient of $$x$$ in
    $$f(v)$$. Similarly we can represent $$a$$ OR $$b$$ as $$f_{a\,
    \mathrm{OR}\, b}(v) =v\cdot \{\{ +a\rightarrow x, +b\rightarrow
    x\}\} - f_{a\, \mathrm{AND}\, b}(v)$$ $$=v \cdot \{\{
    +a\rightarrow x, +b\rightarrow x\}\} -\mathrm{ReLU}(v\cdot
    \{\{a\rightarrow x, b\rightarrow x\}\} - \langle\langle x
    \rangle\rangle)$$.  We now present editable code. The provided
    code maps $$apple$$ OR $$banana$$ to $$yum$$ and $$cherry$$ AND
    $$durian$$ to $$yuck$$.<d-footnote>No offense to lovers of either
    fruit.</d-footnote> As a challenge, consider how you would
    represent $$apple$$ OR $$banana$$ OR $$cherry$$. (You may find
    you need auxilliary semes!)

    <h2>Transformer Attention Layers</h2>
    <p>Finally, we come to the most iconic layer of the Transformer,
      the attention layer. This layer is the only layer in which the
      representations of different words interact.
    </p>
    <p>For now, we deal only with a single attention head for
      simplicity. Later, we will consider multi-head attention. For
      the time being, we are not using positional embeddings, which
      greatly restricts the ability of the network to associate nouns
      with the correct modifiers (and you will see such errors in the
      output of the next figure). We will address this shortcoming
      later, once we have some slightly better notation.

    <h2>Positional Encoding, Explained</h2>

    <p>Here we explain the positional encoding of Transformer. The
      positional encoding is made of of sines and cosines of different
      frequencies. It turns out that this makes the embedding a
      concatenation of a bunch of clock hands. This interpretation is
      shown in the figure below. There are 7 clocks in the figure
      below, one for each of the frequencies we are considering. Click
      on any of the words (or their corresponding number) to see the
      positional embedding corresponding to that word. Each word
      receives the positional embedding that is the 14-dimensional
      concatenation of the seven clock hands described as vectors.
    </p>
    
    <d-figure id="figure-positional" style="border: 1px solid black">
      <svg id="figure-positional-svg" width="500" height="200" />
    </d-figure>
    <script>
      const figurePositional = document.querySelector(
          "d-figure#figure-positional");
      const initTagPositional = document.createElement("div");
      figurePositional.appendChild(initTagPositional);

      figurePositional.addEventListener("ready", function () {
          const initTagPositonal = figurePositional.querySelector("div");
          let animation = positionalAnimation(initTagPositonal);
      });

    </script>

    <p>Why is this useful? It allows us to write weights that interact
      with the positional embeddings (which is necessary to make
      position-dependent inferences) without losing interpretability.
      We do this as follows: first, we note that we can identify
      rotation matrices that move each of the clock-hands forward by
      the same amount that moving forward one word will move them. We
      express this like so:
      <d-code block="" language="markdown">
        querypos: +0
        keypos: +1
      </d-code>
      Here every word will pay attention to the word before it, because
      the key is being advanced one word while the query is not. We
      will put this positional embedding to use in the next section.
    </p>

    <h2>Seq2Seq Transformer for Translation</h2>

    <p>In this section, we show a Transformer programmed to translate
      English to French. This network is solving a toy version of the
      problem (it can handle 300 or so sentences); the author has very
      little knowledge of French, unfortunately, which makes writing
      the decoder difficult.
